JSONcrafter is library used to more generate rich text in Minecraft using its Raw JSON text format.
This API works by taking away the need to manually generate JSON, allowing you the developer to more efficiently generate rich Minecraft text in code.
As the name and description suggest, this library is used to generate text for *Minecraft: Java Edition* specifically.
There is **no** guarantee it will work with *Minecraft: Bedrock Edition*. A Bedrock version may be released in the future, but no promises.

This API was created to aid the development of [Discraft](https://github.com/whirvis/discraft).
As such, it is missing some components present in the Minecraft Raw JSON text API.
This is due to the fact that mostly only needed components were implemented, so as to save time.
If requested, these features will be added in the future.

# Documentation Notice
Some documentation found in this API is taken straight from the [Minecraft Wiki](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Raw_JSON_text_format).
No plagiarism is intended. All text written by the authors at the Minecraft Wiki belongs to their respective owners.
If requested, the documentation will be updated.
